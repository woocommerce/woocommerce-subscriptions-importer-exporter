 * Tweak: link to Checkout/Pay page in the email for a failed automatic payment instead of My Account page
 * Tweak: store recurring discount coupons and amounts for display in Subscriptions 2.0
 * Tweak: no longer automatically cancel subscription when initial order status is changed to refunded to allow the subscription to continue even if the initial amount needs to be refunded (particularly important with WC 2.2)
 * Tweak: display PayPal API credential admin notice even when PayPal is not in debug mode
 * Tweak: reword upgrade/downgrade "apportion" settings to the more semantically accurate "prorate" - props @chrislema

 * Fix: set correct cart contents count, weight, total and tax when cart contains a subscription
 * Fix: require payment when selling a subscription for 1 billing period that has a free trial or is synchronised to a date in the future
 * Fix: when manually adding a subscription, set the initial recurring price to exclude tax (to match the way a price is added for standard products)

 * Tweak: allow switching from one catch all variation to another, as long as the chosen attributes differ between the old subscription and the new one

 * Fix: show $0 initial amount on cart totals when applying a product, cart or sign-up fee coupon to a subscription that does not have a free trial

 * Fix: do not allow a new subscription and subscription renewal to be purchased in the cart at the same time (until 2.0 where multiple subscriptions are supported)

 * Fix: pre-tax recurring % coupon and sign-up fee % coupon discount amounts displayed on cart and checkout totals when purchasing more than one of the same subscription

 * Fix: display correct shipping method labels when recurring shipping price differs to initial shipping price for that method

2013.09.20 - version 1.4
 * New: "Switch" subscriptions feature to allow customers to upgrade/downgrade their subscription: http://docs.woothemes.com/document/subscriptions/switching-guide/
 * New: The payment method used for automatic recurring payments can now be changed by subscribers: http://docs.woothemes.com/document/subscriptions/customers-view/#section-5
 * New: Database structure for subscriptions to improve performance on all sites and fix memory exhaustion issues on sites with tens of thousands of subscriptions. Subscription meta data is now stored in order meta not user meta.
 * New: The recurring shipping method, title, tax and total used for renewals can now be changed by store managers from the 'Edit Order' page of the original order used to purchase the subscription (for those payment gateways which support changing recurring amounts).
 * New: Renewal order emails: using the WooCommerce email system for renewal orders so they can be enabled/disabled, and the content/templates can be customised.
 * New: "Cancelled Subscription" email sent to store managers.
 * New: 'get_subscriptions()' function to help developers easily access and filter customer's subscriptions.
 * New: 'woocommerce_subscriptions_update_users_role' filter to allow extensions to prevent Subscriptions from handling user roles.
 * New: Subscription status, status/end/expiration dates, completed payment list and other meta data can now be changed via the order item meta UI on the Edit Order screen when the WCS_DEBUG constant is set to true.
 * Tweak: Order totals are now $0 when signing up for a subscription with a free trial period making revenue reporting more accurate. Totals on all existing orders will be changed when upgrading.
 * Tweak: On the customer "My Subscriptions" table, show "End Date" column, instead of "Expiration". This column now includes the end date for cancelled/switched subscriptions, or the end of prepaid term date if a cancelled subscription is still within a prepaid term.
 * Tweak: The payment method used for recurring payments is now displayed on the customer's My Subscriptions table (if there are future payments scheduled)
 * Tweak: Allow template overrides of the /single-product/add-to-cart/subscription.php template
 * Tweak: If the WooCommerce "Hold Stock" setting is at the default 60 minutes, Subscriptions will change it to 1 week on upgrade. This avoids the possibility of subscriptions being cancelled when a manual renewal payment is due or when payment takes longer than 60 minutes, like it does when using a PayPal eCheck.
 * Tweak: If a subscription is cancelled without payment, don't allow for it to be renewed (to avoid circumventing sign-up fees)
 * Tweak: The Subscriptions shortcode now includes variation data
 * Tweak: Use WooCommerce date format instead of default WordPress date format
 * Tweak: Reduce memory usage by no longer loading every payment gateway on every page request just to access PayPal's settings
 * Tweak: A subscription is now cancelled with PayPal after a failed payment, rather than allowing PayPal to retry the failed payment n times every 5 days. This allows for Subscriptions to handle the failure, meaning it can immediately suspend the subscription and the customer can log in to pay for the renewal.
 * Fix: Display correct default settings
 * Fix: If a subscription is cancelled before being paid for, don't show the "Pay" button next to it on the My Subscriptions table
 * Fix: When using a sign-up fee equal to the recurring fee, and a free trial, make sure the correct amount is sent to PayPal
 * Fix: For variable subscription products with no variations, fix the price string (should be "-" not " / day").
 * Fix: Don't assign the deafult inactive role to a subscriber when one subscription is cancelled/expires, but they have other active subscriptions
 * Fix: Incorrectly charging a second payment for subscription variations that were meant to be for 1 billing period
 * Fix: Incorrectly set trial expiration dates for subscription variations which have different trial expirations
